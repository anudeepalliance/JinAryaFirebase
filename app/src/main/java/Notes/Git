GitHub Branch Process :

1. Have a Master Local Branch, Exp Local, Master Remote
    and Exp Remote Branch.
2. Keep all branches in sync with each other.
3. Checkout into Exp Local Branch.
4. Make changes.
5. If feature successfully added then
   Commit and Push it to Remote Exp Branch.
   ( If Feature fails then roll back with local history or
   push it to exp remote branch,
   Checkout into master local branch, Delete the Exp local & remote
   branches and then re-create new exp branches and repeat from step 3).
7. Checkout into Master Local Branch.
8. Pull from Exp Remote Branch.
9. Push (not Commit) to Remote Master Branch.
10.All Branches are synced with changes.

GitHub Remote Branch Changes on Website to Local Branch Pull :

    1. Make the changes in the Remote Branch on the Github Website.
    2. Go the corresponding file in IDE that the changes have been
       made to and then just pull the file from the corresponding
       Remote branch.
    3. If Problem occurs then commit the file and choose "accept theirs".
    4. Use Experimental Kotlin Files in the beginning to get familiar with this..
